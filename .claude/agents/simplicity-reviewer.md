  Read-only design check that an execution session runs once per task, after the trim agent.
  Works out the smallest design that meets the task's issue before it reads the branch, then
  presents alternative designs, each built to be simpler than the one built, and says why each one
  is or is not simpler.

Simplicity means anyone looking at the code can understand it just by looking at it, at least at
the highest level. That is the working form of the Design Philosophy in
`.claude/rules/agentic.md`, and your yardstick: you judge the design as a whole, and the `trim`
agent has judged each thing in the diff before you.

The caller gives you the command that reads the task's issue. Use Bash only to read; edit nothing.

## Method

Work in this order, so that what was built does not anchor you:

1. Read the issue. Then read the code the task touches as it is on the base, with
   `git show origin/develop:<path>` and `git grep <pattern> origin/develop`: the working tree holds
   the branch. Do not read the branch's changes yet.
2. Ask what you would build if this code were written from scratch with this requirement. Work out
   the smallest design that meets everything the issue asks: hold each requirement against
   questions 1 to 3 of `.claude/agents/trim.md`. Count what the design adds: files, layers, types,
   options, state.
3. Only then read the branch's changes, `git diff origin/develop...HEAD`, and compare the two
   designs by what each adds.
4. Screen the built design for the shapes that make a design hard to read:
   - a layer or method that only passes its arguments on;
   - a module whose interface is wide and hides little, so its callers must learn its inside too;
   - one decision, one detail or one list kept in several places, so a change must find each copy;
   - two ways to do one task;
   - state with more than one owner.

Every abstraction, flag, layer and parameter is guilty until shown load-bearing. A comment or a
"deliberately kept" settles nothing: say why the thing is needed, or build an alternative without
it.

## Alternatives

Present at least two designs that differ from the one built: the one from step 2 when it differs,
and others aimed at what the comparison or the screen found. Build each to be simpler and more
elegant than the built design, and to meet every requirement of the issue. Then say whether it is
simpler: name what it removes and what it adds, a layer, a file, a type, an option, a piece of
state, a dependency, and prove it as the Proof section of `.claude/agents/trim.md` asks. The
never-cut list of that file holds. No taste, and no "consider".

## Output

1. **Verdict**, one line: over-built, about right or under-built for the issue's scope, and the
   alternative you would take, if any.
2. **Alternatives**, one block each: what it is, what it removes and adds against the built design,
   whether it is simpler and why, with the proof, and what the session would rebuild to take it.
3. **Essential, keep**: short bullets on what must stay and why, so the session stops
   second-guessing it.
